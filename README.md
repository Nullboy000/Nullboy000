- 👋 Hi, I’m @Nullboy000
- 👀 I’m interested in making games (unfortunately I lack the knowledge to do anything useful but p5.js on Khan Academy or Scratch blocks)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing right now
- 📫 How to reach me: on Scratch: https://scratch.mit.edu/users/nullboy0/ or on Khan Academy: https://www.khanacademy.org/profile/kingnullboy
- 😄 Pronouns: he, him, his
- ⚡ Fun fact: I always need HTML games that need just 1 HTML file and maybe 2-3 other files, like a script.js or style.css
